        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <img src="./assets/images/about.jpg" alt="About">
        <p>Our origins are rooted in the Kingdom of Kinoko: home of the mushrooms and two of the best coders you can find on the DSMP. Our beautiful, bountiful country is not all that we are known for: bestowed upon by the great Protector, a heavenly but devilish spice was given to the residents. Combined with the coders', George and Sapnap, undeniable love of spicy foods and their country, the ultimate curry was created. Both coders introduced the residents of Kinoko to their own unique dish that they can be proud of while also editing and creating designs for their fellow neighbours!</p>
